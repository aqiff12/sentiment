Tory treasurer cleared of false campaign spending claims
A letter from the Special Enquiry Team to Simon Day’s solicitors said there was “insufficient evidence” to substantiate any allegation he “knowingly or recklessly” made a false claim.

The case was referred to the police by the Electoral Commission after it fined the Conservatives for not declaring £275,813 in campaign spending.

It was alleged that the party gained a “financial advantage” in the election by bussing activists to key battlegrounds and paying their costs without listing the expenses correctly.

Mr Day’s lawyer, Gary Bloxsome, said: “This was a matter that should never have been referred from the Electoral Commission to the police.”
A Conservative spokesman said: “We welcome the finding ... that Simon has been exonerated of any wrongdoing.”
